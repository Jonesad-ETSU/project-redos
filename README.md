# Project Redos

Welcome to my redo repo. This repository contains a few projects that I made following the completion of the Course 'React - The Complete Guide'. I attempted to redo the projects with the new knowledge that I had acquired from watching further but only with the technologies covered up to that point.

## 01

This project is a simple List showing app with a form. It allows adding and removing Users (both done via prop drilling).
